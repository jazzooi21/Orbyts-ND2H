No uncertainties given, so uncertainties are based on
the quoted precision of the transition frequencies ie 0.1 MHz.
Inversion symmetry not given but two frequencies are given for each rotational
quantum number, the largest frequency of which is taken to be the one where the 
inversion symmetry of the upper state is antisymmetric (later labelled sources are
used to double-check)
